Hi. This file contains my ideas for the orma messenger. Some of them may be added in the future.

Ideas:
'''1. TLS 1.3 (AES-256 algorithm)
2. No logging policy
3. minimum data required for registration
4. p2p
5. May be Tor bridges support
6. Fast, flexible and easy to use interface
7. Full chat encryption
8. End-to-end encryption
9. Customization options
10. May be no web rtc usage'''
